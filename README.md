# stock-analysis
Analysis of green stock data.

## Overview of Project:
The purpose of this analysis is to refactor intial code to create a more efficent program that can handle larger data sets and provide requested outputs. 

## Results
There are many differences in stock performance from 2017 to 2018. The volumes are varying from year to year, some resulting in an increase in volume while others display a decrease in volume. Most noticably, you can see that every stock, with the exception of 2, deemed a negative return in 2018. It would be advisable to invest in ENPH and RUN as these are the only two that resulted in a positive return for both 2017 and 2018. 

## Summary
### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
There are many advantages to refactoring code. This project started with the creation of a simple code to analyze a small data set. By reviewing and refactoring the code, the program became more efficient and is now able to handle a larger data set. Also, the program is now cleaner and simpler to understand in order to follow for future enhancemenets. Refactoring code is vital to creating an adaptive and efficent program. The only disadvantage or case to dismiss refactoring is if you do not understand the code. This can lead to more inefficiencies and lost time.

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
By refactoring the original VBA code, the program became faster and more efficient. It was able to analyze more data and automatically provide the results requested within a fraction of a second.
